				<p>I write, compose, sing, play, produce and mix music.</p>
				<p>In 2017, I released my debut single and EP on Spotify, Apple Music and all other major music streaming platforms. 'JAIE' comes from my name in Chinese &#38515;&#25165;&#20736; and is a little homage towards my roots as a Chinese Malaysian.</p>
				<p>Starting out as a way to share my creations on Soundcloud and pour feelings into three-minute windows, music has grown into much more than that, becoming a way to move, feel and connect with others.</p>

			<div id="sec-musical-blocks">
				<p>A semester-long project for INFO 4320 Rapid Prototyping and Physical Computing.</p>
				<p>Musical Cubes are fun and interactive devices that allow users to create music by moving cubes in different positions over a colour gradient. Users can select the different instruments by using a touch sensor. The cubes use a colour sensor to detect the colour it is placed on, then translates this RGB value into a MIDI event. The cube consists of a colour sensor, capacitive touch sensor, LED ring, and is controlled by an Adafruit 32u4 board which uses a 500mAh battery and Bluetiith Low Energy to communicate remotely with a computer. This project combines the knowledge of hardware, software, design and mechanics.</p>

			<div id="sec-pauseture">
				<p>Project for INFO 4120 Ubiquitous Computing.</p>
				<p>PAUSE-ture is a head and neck posture correction system that aims to improve the posture of users who spend extended periods of time working at their desks using design principles based on calm technology and mindless computing. The system is designed as a wearable device that attaches onto over-ear headphones. The system provides subtle audio and visual feedback to notify the user to correct his or her posture when poor posture is detected. The goal of the PAUSE-ture project is to provide an unobtrusive posture correction and training system which targets forward head posture. This started as a semester-long project for INFO 4120 Ubiquitous Computing, but we are continuing to conduct further research into this area of study to discover the possibilities of audio feedback.</p>

			<div id="sec-guac">
				<p>Frontend web development for Cornell University's first ever travel magazine using Javascript, D3 and Bootstrap.</p>
				<p>Collaborating with Guac's backend web developer and design lead, we built the magazine's web platform and content from scratch, including an interactive world map SVG that link to articles. Within our first year of launching, Guac received the <span>James A. Perkins Prize for Interracial & Intercultural Peace & Harmony</span> for our impact on campus: promoting diversity and openness to learning about other cultures.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="sec-brands">
				<p>Group project for INFO3300 Data-Driven Web Applications.</p>
				<p>Using Javascript D3 and Google Search Data, we created a static data visualization of search interest in selected fashion brands across the USA. We collected the data from Google and analyzed different geographical trends over the country.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="sec-genders">
				<p>Final Project for INFO3300 Data-Driven Web Applications.</p>
				<p>We created a data visualization of gender trends in various academic disciplines from the 60's onwards. The project uses enrollment rates for different college majors organized by gender. The female to male ratio is represented by a colour gradient in each blob.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="sec-echo">
				<p>An exploration into the intersections of music, multimedia art, HCI and computer programming with <a href="http://www.laewoo.com/portfolio/" target="_blank">Leo Kang</a>.</p>
				<p>The goal of this research project is to discover the possibilities within technology that is considered obsolete. The 'echo' uses an Arduino microcontroller to trigger sounds made from randomly found machinery.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="sec-esw">
				<p>Product manager and electrical engineer for Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW).</p>
				<p>Designed, prototyped, tested and built a portable solar powered phone charger aimed for users in rural communities in Nicaragua. This charger was designed to be attached to a backpack to allow the user to charge on the go since the target user travels by bike and on foot for long hours during the day.</p>
