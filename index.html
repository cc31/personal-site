				<p>A semester-long project for INFO 4320 Rapid Prototyping and Physical Computing.</p>
				<p>Musical Cubes are designed to be a music creation tool that requires no existing experience or knowledge in music theory. By moving cubes across a color gradient, the cubes generate musical notes. Users can select the different instruments by using a touch sensor on the top side of the cube. The cubes use a colour sensor to detect the colour it is placed on, then translates this RGB value into a MIDI event. The cube consists of a colour sensor, capacitive touch sensor, LED ring, and is controlled by an Adafruit 32u4 board which uses a 500mAh battery and Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate remotely with a computer. This project combines skills in hardware, software, design, mechanics and music.</p>
				<img src="images/insides.jpeg">
				<p>This video shows one of the early prototype iterations where RGB values from the color sensor are being mapped to pitch and velocity in MIDI. The MIDI events are triggered on a set time interval and audio output is via Logic Pro X on a laptop.</p>

				<img src="images/pauseture-demo.jpeg">
				<p>Project for INFO 4120 Ubiquitous Computing.</p>
				<p>PAUSE-ture is a head and neck posture correction system that aims to improve the posture of users who spend extended periods of time working at their desks using design principles based on calm technology and mindless computing. The system is designed as a wearable device that attaches onto over-ear headphones. The system provides subtle audio and visual feedback to notify the user to correct his or her posture when poor posture is detected. The goal of the PAUSE-ture project is to provide an unobtrusive posture correction and training system which targets forward head posture. This started as a semester-long project for INFO 4120 Ubiquitous Computing, but we are continuing to conduct further research into this area of study to discover the possibilities of audio feedback.</p>

				<p>An interactive box where a user presses a button, which makes a laser-cut ​gudetama​ japanese cartoon character pop up and lift the lid of the box.</p><p>The mechanism of this pop up involves a servo motor and 3 cams. When button-state is pressed, the servo rotates to a specified angle, which rotates the 3 cams, and lifts the cartoon figure up. The gudetama figure is placed in between to vertical slits in the left and right face of the box, which allows it to move up and down while still maintaining its balance across the cams. The 3 cams are laser cut acrylic and attached to the lego shaft. The lego shaft is attached to the servo using a circular piece of laser cut acrylic which attaches to the servo using screws and wires. All other parts of the box, including the hinge, were designed in Fusion and laser cut on acrylic.</p>

				<p>Production, Intentions, Decisions</p>
				<p>This piece is an exploration of what a guitar is and can do without its strings. The guitar is suspended in the air by its 6th E string and 3rd G string. The guitar utilizes its own strings to carry its weight, to show that the body can hold on it’s own without needing to be supported by anything or anyone else. With this set up, the guitar lays independently and completely bare.</p>
				<img src="images/shapingsound5.jpeg">
				<p>The idea to use organic materials (rice grains) to create a soundscape was inspired by a conversation with a friend and Michael Pisaro’s “A Wave and Waves”. As a music producer, new sounds are easily achieved through digital manipulation. In contrast, I set out to explore acoustic sounds made completely naturally in this set up. It was a new experience exploring sounds and the application of an instrument in an organic way for this project. All the sounds created in this project are controlled solely by the shape of the guitar and the movement of the grains. The advice to “let the shape of the instrument shape the sound” encouraged me to explore the different curvatures and surfaces of the guitar body that are not usually utilized or paid attention to.</p>
				<p>Final Video</p>

				<p>The visuals of this piece aim to create a sense of foreignness towards the instrument. Since the guitar is such a familiar and widely played musical instrument in popular culture, I was interested in finding new ways of observing and using the instrument, to challenge the concept of a guitar. The closeups, odd angles and suspension of the guitar allows the audience to view the shapes of the instrument from unconventional perspectives. The audio used in the video was recorded using a Zoom mic and then cut together in Logic Pro X.</p>

					Project for INFO4410 Human-Robot Interaction, Cornell University.
				</p>
				<p>
					Working in a small group, we designed and built a robot with the aim of encouraging people to dance to foster inclusivity in social settings. This project consisted of initial story-boarding, multiple stages of interaction design, physical prototyping and user testing. To build the robot, we used a deconstructed disco ball, servo and stepper motors, two Arduino Unos, a HC-05 Bluetooth module, and 3D-printed mount and gears.
