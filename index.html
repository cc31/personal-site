				<p>I write, compose, sing, play, produce and mix music.</p>
				<p>In 2017, I released my debut single and EP on Spotify, Apple Music and all other major music streaming platforms. 'JAIE' comes from my name in Chinese &#38515;&#25165;&#20736; and is a little homage towards my roots as a Chinese Malaysian.</p>
				<p>Starting out as a way to share my creations on Soundcloud and pour feelings into three-minute windows, music has grown into much more than that, becoming a way to move, feel and connect with others.</p><p><span>560k Streams, 176k Listeners and growing!</span></p>

			<div id="section2">
				<p>Frontend web development for Cornell University's first ever travel magazine using Javascript, D3 and Bootstrap.</p>
				<p>Collaborating with Guac's backend web developer and design lead, we built the magazine's web platform and content from scratch, including an interactive world map SVG that link to articles. Within our first year of launching, Guac received the <span>James A. Perkins Prize for Interracial & Intercultural Peace & Harmony</span> for our impact on campus: promoting diversity and openness to learning about other cultures.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="section3">
				<p>Group project for INFO3300 Data-Driven Web Applications.</p>
				<p>Using Javascript D3 and Google Search Data, we created a static data visualization of search interest in selected fashion brands across the USA. We collected the data from Google and analyzed different geographical trends over the country.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="section4">
				<p>Final Project for INFO3300 Data-Driven Web Applications.</p>
				<p>We created a data visualization of gender trends in various academic disciplines from the 60's onwards. The project uses enrollment rates for different college majors organized by gender. The female to male ratio is represented by a colour gradient in each blob.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="section5">
				<p>An exploration into the intersections of music, multimedia art, HCI and computer programming.</p>
				<p>This is a research project that aims to discover the possibilities within technology that is obsolete. The 'echo' uses an Arduino microcontroller to trigger sounds made from randomly found machinery.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="section6">
				<p>A semester-long project for INFO 4320 Rapid Prototyping and Physical Computing.</p>
				<p>This project is currently in the works! We are designing a physical surface that can be used as an intuitive and playful interface to create music through spatial gestures and movement.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="section7">
				<p>Project for INFO 4120 Ubiquitous Computing.</p>
				<p>I am currently designing and prototyping a wearable device that will help correct head and neck posture, targeted to people who work for long hours at their desk. The research goal of this project is to figure out optimal types of feedback that can encourage corrective posture and minimize the intrusiveness of the wearable technology.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="section8">
				<p>Product manager and electrical engineer for Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW).</p>
				<p>Designed, prototyped, tested and built a portable solar powered phone charger aimed for users in rural communities in Nicaragua. This charger was designed to be attached to a backpack to allow the user to charge on the go since the target user travels by bike and on foot for long hours during the day.</p>
